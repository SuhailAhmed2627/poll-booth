# Poll Booth 👕

Poll Booth is a user management and interaction Web App made with MERN stack, REST APIs and lots of Love❤️.

## Why?
[Delta](https://delta.nitt.edu/)'s WebDev Task-3. Learnt the following Technologies:

- [React ⚛️](https://reactjs.org/)
- [JWT 🔒 ](https://jwt.io/)
- [Express.js ✨](https://expressjs.com/)
- [MongoDB 💾](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Mongoose 🍃](https://mongoosejs.com/)
- [Parcel 📦](https://parceljs.org/)
- [Insomnia 🔮](https://insomnia.rest/)

This is my first MERN stack project. Some duct-tape fixes are present due to lack of time to finish the task in Hackermode. Wrote 2,500+ lines of code, Loved the Experience of making a Full Stack project.
